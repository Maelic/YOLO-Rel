# Ultralytics YOLO11n + Relationship Detection model
# This config adds relationship detection capabilities on top of YOLO11n object detection
# Model docs: https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11
# Task docs: https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect

# Base model to inherit from
base_model: yolo11n.pt

# Parameters
nc: 133 # number of object classes (PSG dataset has 133 object classes)
relation_classes: 56 # number of relation classes (PSG dataset has 56 relations)

# Relationship detection specific parameters
relation_params:
  feat_dim: 512        # Feature dimension for relationship attention
  top_k: 100          # Number of top relationship pairs to consider
  temperature: 8.0    # Temperature for attention scaling
  hidden_dim: 256     # Hidden dimension for relationship classifier
  dropout: 0.1        # Dropout rate for relationship head

# Training parameters specific to relations
relation_training:
  pos_weight: 10.0    # Positive weight for BCE loss (relations are sparse)
  neg_weight: 1.0     # Negative weight for BCE loss
  relation_loss_weight: 1.0  # Weight for relationship loss vs detection loss

# Model compound scaling constants - inherited from base YOLO11
scales: # model compound scaling constants, i.e. 'model=yolo11n-rel.yaml' will call yolo11n-rel.yaml with scale 'n'
